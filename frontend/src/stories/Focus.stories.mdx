# Focus state

Focus state in OpenProject is represented by a 2-pixel outline around the focused element.

_Active_ is a similar state as focused, but not entirely the same. For example, in the date picker, the start date can be "active" (meaning that clicking on a date in the mini-calendar will change the start date) but not in focus (because the mouse has clicked outside of the field).
